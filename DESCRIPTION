Package: SparsePanelMatch
Type: Package
Title: Applies Imai, Kim & Wang (2018) "Matching Methods for Causal Inference with Time-Series Cross-Sectional Data" to sparse panel data where observations are irregular and there are many missing values.

Description: This package allows users to implement Imai, Kim & Wang's PanelMatch package for irregular panel data (e.g. elections). The adapted procedure has four phases: (1) Match each treated observation (unit-time) with control observations occurring within a user-defined time window (this is the only significant difference to the original method, where it is assumed that the panel data is well-ordered and regular, meaning that each observation is matched with every other observation at that year/month/date), (2) Within that matched set, find control observations with exactly the same treatment history over the last n period (e.g. over the last 3 election cycles), (3) Within that matched set, refine further using either Propensity Scores, Covariate Balancing Propensity Scores or Mahalanobis distance, (4) Calculate a Difference-in-Difference estimator across the matched set (with bootstrapped standard errors)
